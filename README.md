# Coldsteel Engine
This is the first large-scale project I created while learning to code. Coldsteel Engine is a 2D game engine which uses OpenGL to render images, Nuklear UI for UI, Python for scripting, and even has very 
simplistic and incomplete networking via UDP. The engine being developed for use for a Castlevania Fan Game, hence why many of the engine's data files refer to Castlevania characters.
## Features
* Rendering images as graphics
* Custom built collision and physics system
* Large Python scripting layer via Jython
* Primitive multiplayer networking via UDP
* Custom animation system allowing illformed sprite sheets to be used for animations
* Custom hitbox system
* Level editing and tileset system
* Custom item system
* Custom ECS systems for entities and items
